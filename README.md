GETTING STARTED:
* DO NOT MISS THE .babelrc at project root!
* To get the app running do :
    1. Go to project root
    2. run 
        $ yarn add live-server babel-cli@6.24.1
    3. run
        $ yarn devServer

* RESTART devServer whenever YOU EDIT 
        webpack.config.js

* To change your entry point of your app go to
        webpack.config.js
and edit 
        entry:  './src/app.js'
